    static String[] festivals = {"Festival of Returns – Celebrated by keeping one’s door open all day during festivities. In remembrance of the day that countless missing people returned home after an adventuring group of paladins vanquished a coven of hags who had been stealing people away in the night for their rituals", "Weaver’s Eve – An artful festival for fabric makers. Celebrates the day when the nearby forest’s local spider population came to the townspeople asking for help to safeguard their nests from foraging cockatrices. The local seamstresses responded by making large, sturdy fabric webs for the spiders to hide in until the cockatrices could be dealt with.", "Day of Stone – Celebrated as a masonry recognition day. Began as a day of remembrance some hundreds of years before when Hunters returned to town only to find that every person had been turned to stone by a roaming Medusa.", "The Haunt – A day when people offload their grievances with one another, lest they be haunted by holding it in. In recognition of the day long ago when a necromancer bestowed a curse of silent aggression over the town until people began killing one another, then raising them for his army of dead.", "The Honey Moon festival – Every few months, the moon will rise with a golden glow for two or three nights. In the little town of &amp;amp;lt;im bad at names&amp;amp;gt; they say that the moon does this when someone, somewhere, finds true love. During these days, tables are set out in the streets and people ask others to join them on dates, platonic and romantic, underneath the golden moonlight (similar to real world valentines dates).", "The Barstool Burning – After an incident where a mimic disguised as a barstool bit off a chunk of a poor patron’s bum, the tavern’s inebriated clientele burned all its barstools in the street. An afternoon of drinking and building street bonfires made of barstools and other flammables has since become an annual holiday that has spread to all the taverns in the city. The taverns use the bump in proceeds to buy new barstools.", "Monster Parade – Once a year, all the cities in region hold a parade where all the participants wear elaborate monster costumes. Larger cities may employ magicians for special effects and have multistory beasts mounted on wheeled carts with movable parts and participants riding inside. The final attraction in the parade is the “holy paladin” with an elaborate armor outfit and costume weapons who is driving the “monsters” away. The role of the paladin is chosen by popularity contest or some other method, and is almost never an actual paladin. The parade celebrates a plot to deter a foreign attack by making it appear that terrifying monsters had already overrun the streets, yet they were easily defeated and driven off by guards.", "The Bath and Swim – This “festival” originated in a region with intermittent vampire problems. When another drained person is found, every man, woman, and child in the territory are ordered to assemble and wade across a shallow river. Immobile people are carried and then submerged. A census is then taken, and anyone who didn’t show up or refused (even visitors) is captured and dunked. Bored youths waiting for the trials to end soon started a now traditional swimming contest in the deeper part of the river. Thanks to a pair of enterprising visiting bards, a recurring comedy act developed. Two bards playing an oblivious guard and a vampire sit in a single large wooden bath and deliver “Straight Man and Wise Guy” skits. The comedy act has an informative end: it addresses vampire powers and weaknesses, and cautions against explicitly inviting anyone into your home, or your bath.", "Masquerade ball – An event for the upper classes and nobility. Participants ballroom dance while wear highly concealing masks and costumes. Because everyone’s identities are ostensibly hidden, participants are expected to cut loose. Statements challenging authority, outrageous clothing, lascivious dancing, public displays of affection, impoliteness, crude jokes, and open gossip is also permitted. Many champions of silenced and oppressed factions voiced their first manifestos here. The masquerade ball is a can’t-miss for anyone investigating aristocratic allegiances and doings, social climbers seeking courtly influence, and underworld rogues looking for high level protection and buyers.", "Catacomb Carnival – Once per year in the great cities the citizens head to the catacombs to celebrate another year alive and honor the dead interred in them by properly cleaning and arranging the bones of those that have been in the catacombs for a year into elaborate structures and designs. Any bones that are damaged in any way are burned in a great pyre in the city square and the ashes are used in the mortar of the bone sculptures below. They also leave offerings to the beetles and rats that do the job of stripping the bodies down to the bone. After the catacombs have been cleaned and the years previous dead have been attended to there is a day and night of celebration where revelers light the catacombs and tunnels and celebrate in procession above and below the streets wearing masks of beetles, rats, and skeletons to ward off any dark spirits and denizens that might also haunt the dark recesses below the city.", "The Minstrel Masquerade – A yearly festival wherein bards gather from every kingdom to enjoy one another’s company. Every bard seeks an invitation to such a jovial event, but only a few will be deemed worthy of winning a “Bardy.” The masquerade’s origin stems from the tragedy of Gerrick the Mad. Gerrick was a loyal jester, a bard of Lore, whom kept his sleepless king laughing for 3 months straight. Unfortunately Gerrick was only a man, a simple bard, and when the king finally gave word for him to stop jesting, he fell to the ground, stone dead. This festival exists to honor Gerrick and other bards alike for their insatiable desire to be the best artistic minds in their kingdoms, and the horrid sacrifice Gerrick made for the price of his King’s smile.", "The Salmon Bulb Run – It is this time each year that the giant salmon (which dwell within the nearby rivers) finish their yearly rot on the shores of nearby villages. You see, each year the salmon spawn, die, then float to shore causing a special type of psychedelic river mushroom to form on their carcasses (after they rot for approximately a year). These mushrooms are collected and shared amongst the Firbolg community as a right of passage.", "Winter’s Ritual Day – To prepare the day before, a branch of the sacred tree is cut and carved into a bowl, in it, runes are scribed asking for what you want come Spring and the next year; fortune, fertility or good health and inside is placed a special candle. After midnight, the candle is lit by a special bonfire created by the temple. A special ceremony is held at midday, where the priest incants a ritual spell ceremony, asking that the city be warded from the Spirit of Winter till next year. After this ceremony, which lasts 5 hours, the people drink ale and sup broth from their bowl cup (candle still lit hopefully), until midnight when they blow out the candle. If your candle goes out beforehand, terrible luck will befall you in the coming year.", "Day of Mending – A celebration to better one’s community and strenghten the bonds between townsfolk, this holiday is a day when tailors, crafters, smithies and similar trades set aside their work for a day offer their services for free on small projects for members of their community. As the holiday has grown, it has become a tradition for others to offer their goods and services to the community as well: bakers give away small food stuffs, taverns offer drinks on the house (one per customer!), and musicians and artisans flaunt their talents to all. Many enjoy the holiday as an opportunity to bond with their neighbors and community, while the more savvy use it as an opportunity for self promotion. The primary tenet of the Day of Mending is that old grudges and quarrels are set aside, if only for the day, and folk put the community ahead of the individual before the old business resumes on the following day.", "The Lovers’ Return – One night each year, it is said that the spirits of a young man and woman return to roam the town where they died, looking for each other. Old tales tell of the young lovers kept apart, until one committed suicide from grief, only to be shortly followed into death by their partner. Now, the oldest townsfolk whisper of seeing the crimson specter of half-seen figures, sometimes a young man, sometimes a young woman, roaming the town on the night of the Lovers’ Return, rapping lightly on the doors of homes to be let inside to search for their lost love. The townsfolk believe that hanging certain totems around their entryways will keep the lovers from coming to their doors, but even so, every few years a young man or a young woman goes missing on the Lover’s Return, presumably taken away by one of the specters mistaking them for their lost partner.", "Winter’s Offering – An old holiday, mostly celebrated by rural farming communities, it serves as both a celebration to venerate the old gods as well as preparing the villages for the winter to come. After the fall harvest, each household is granted a number of bushels of the food grown, while a large portion of it is prepared and sealed in unadorned clay urns to be buried in the ground and kept in reserve for the cold, hungry months of winter. As well, the villagers bury the bodies of their young at this time: the stillborn and the infants who passed in the previous year, their bodies prepared and buried in urns painted black, offerings to the old gods. The old midwives of such communities often keep unruly children in line with tales of how the cries and tears caused by misbehaving children echo into the ground and cause the blackened urns to crack, prompting their buried occupants to crawl their way out to the surface and drag away bad little boys and girls.", "Festival of the Sashes – to commemorate the purge of a despotic royal lineage centuries ago, when the ruling family was chased out of town by the commoners, their clothing stripped of their bodies as they ran through the streets. Groups and families prepare mannequins adorned with colorful sashes, each trying to make theirs the most elaborate and festive. The mannequins are then hoisted on poles and carried through the city. The groups race from Royal Plaza to the city gates. People line the streets and try to grab and tear handfuls of the sashes and ornamentation off as the mannequins pass. The atmosphere is very festive with public drunkenness and groups of young people chasing after the mannequins.", "Week of Rest – Neighbors take turns cooking meals for each other. Based on when a plague swept through the town and some got better while others got sick.", "Monument Race Day – It is said that when a near by volcano erupted destroying the old town, after evacuating their families many of the villagers returned to move the stone monument from the old town center to the new town’s location. In honor of this deed, every year on the anniversary of the eruption, the townspeople form teams that carry replica monuments in a race from the site of the old village to the monuments’s current location. Afterwards the town celebrates by having lava soup (a spicy red tomato based soup), with monument shaped bread rolls.", "Lamentations of the Cinders – a somber day of reflection on the anniversary of the Great Fire that killed thousands. At third bell after noon, which is when the fire began, people begin silently filing from their homes. Everyone covers their faces with soot and ash. Particularly devout people or older folk who lost everything in the fire may go completely naked and cover their whole body in soot. Citizens keep their faces downcast as they slowly walk a circuit around the neighborhoods that were most affected. A bell tolls every minute for the lives that were lost. At sundown everyone quietly returns home. Recently people have begun to include a great feast of preserved foods, like jerky, salted fish, and dried fruit afterwards.", "Last Tidings – It is said there once was a witchy lass who fell in love with a sailor. He went to sea and for twentyfive years she would wait for him at the sea cliff until the last tide went out at dusk. On the final night of her vigil on the last outgoing tide of the year she received word that her lover had perished. She cursed and vowed to the heavens that nobody would ever have to suffer and wait as long as she did for closure. She performed some unknown ritual and ever since that night, on the last out going tide of the last day of the year, anybody who whispers the name of a loved one on the seaside cliff will either hear the name returned meaning they were still alive or hear the cry of an albatross and know them perished. Two night long festivals have arisen one mourning the other joyous as lovers learn the truth. It is no coincidence that many of the single participants find comfort and more in each other’s company.", "Wall of Melons – A hundred years ago the city was under siege. The invaders climbed a wall to get inside only to be rebuffed by peasants who tore down their own homes to toss rocks down on the climbers. The day is celebrated by a committee selecting a portion of wall up witch a the town’s young men try to clamber. At top are an equal bumber of lasses armed with melons both ripe and rotten. It isbl traditional for the first climber up to ask for and be given the hand in marriage of his choice. The climbers are protected by feather fall spells and blanket carrying elders.", "Sweet Night – The orchids of fruit trees in the town’s fields are pollinated by bats from a local cave. This wasn’t known until a hundred years ago when a vampire ravaged the country side. It was tracked back to the cave and burned out, scattering the bats as well. The next years harvests were bad until a traveling holy man told the villagers they must lure the vats back. This was done by pouring syrup and other sweets out on a long path from orchards to cave. It worked and has become an annual event to remind and thank the bats. The sweets used have become candies for children and alcohol for adults. It starts with a barnfire at dusk and culminates in a long hike to the cave. Dancing and costume wearing is common as well as many bat theme toys and souvenirs.", "War of the Monsters – An Olympic sports like event with many different athletic competitions and games. The main event is a destruction derby style event where groups make “monster wagons”. Essentially people driven/powered wagons/carts that are made to look like monsters of the world (dragons, dire animals, beholders, etc). The goal is just to disable the opponents wagons, not hurt the drivers. Last monster wagon still able to roll wins. History harkens back to a day many many years, when several large wild monsters wandered into town at the same time. They ended up fighting each other rather then attacking the people, in a territorial dispute. This gave the civilians time to evacuate and adventurers time to gain control of the situation. Contradictory stories developed how one monster (it’s always a different one, since no one agrees which it was) was actually there to save the City from the other monsters. As several monsters actually escaped, this “hero” monster is said to still be out there guarding the city. People in the city are split into groups by what monster they believe is their guardian.", "Day of stillness – No-one goes outside or opens doors for 3 days. Very worrying to newcomers to the huge city. It is surreal to see a giant city completely still and silent. Almost no lights and no answers. In remembrance in how they barely escaped the plague by not greeting any infected during those trying times.", "Day of the Hawk – Adepts at the shortbow and longbow compete in a test of skill and accuracy (ex. piercing a thrown copper penny-sized item in the center), hitting fast moving targets from horseback. Gnome artificers, smiths, and other weapons craftsmen travel to the city from far and wide to tout their new inventions and wares. The festival began when the city was a small village and those who came of age had to prove their proficiency with the weapon as part of demonstrating their skills in order to successfully hunt and defend the community.", "The Day of Ribbons – An annual occasion where beautiful ribbons are tied to posts all over town. When asked why, people only give a somber look. Nobody speaks about it, giving the impression that it’s disrespectful and insulting to do so.", "The Night of Burning – In memory of the defeat of an ancient black dragon that had kept them in slavery, this town has an annual tradition where they kill, cook, and eat a juvenile black dragon.", "Orctoberfest – A yearly weeklong celebration commemorating the defeat of a massive army of orcs that had once besieged the city. Lots of drinking of fermented beverages, dancing, and general public revelry.", "Market’s Day – A day of great deals and bargains from merchants and vendors. It marks the beginning of the new market year and celebrates when the open trading and selling of dwarven and elvish wares to humans was legalized throughout the land.", "Candlenights – A night when the entire city holds a candlelight vigil until the dead of night, and then exchanging gifts and celebrating with a feast. Groups of families and neighbors stand around the city in patches, while holding their candles up high. This commemorates the time when a group of adventurers killed a nest of gold dragons, relieving many of the farmers of the fear of being killed and their crops burned. The adventurers brought back the dragon’s hoard to share with the town, but because of a raging blizzard, had to be guided in by groupings of torches.", "Day of Snakes – a day literally celebrating the existence of snakes. Vendors sell all kinds of snake-related items, restaurants serve dishes with a bit of snake flair added on, and people release their pet snakes all around town. This goes far back to when there was a large rat pestilence in the town, and it looked like it would never get better until a random snake merchant came to town and offered to begin breeding snakes for them in order to control the population. Disease rates fell, overall cleanliness increased, and the town felt better overall after the rats were driven down to a dwindle.", "Propitiation of the Twins – around twenty years ago a pair of shooting stars appeared in the night sky. Soothsayers and astrologers predicted that this would usher in a new age of prosperity. People began leaving offerings in public squares to entice “the Twins” to bless their household. Now, every year on the anniversary, people have continued the tradition by lighting two candles and leaving a small bread cake in a public area at dusk.", "Boulder Pushing Day – On this day every year, the town splits into 2 teams (east and west). Using the whole town as a playing field, they attempt to push a boulder sized ball (many years ago they realized that a real boulder caused too much damage to the town)towards the opposite side of town. The winning team must push the ball into the outskirts of the town on the opposing side. It’s a friendly competition akin to a high school sports rivalry. Those who cheat or intentionally hurt others are looked down upon by their peers. The town sits in a u shaped valley that they say the gods carved out by rolling a marble on flat land.", "The day of Ashes – more of a ritual than a actual holiday. At this specific day of the year, the towns women get dressed in white and their faces are covered behind a veil. They roam the streets in packs singing and dancing, while the men, all dressed in black, try to coerce the women into having intercourse. Women are treated like goddesses, gifts are given to them and they have free choice of taking or refusing a partner. Each woman has a pot filled with ashes with her. After they have found and bedded their man of choice, they empty their pot onto his clothes, so the other women know not to touch them. This tradition comes from ancient times, when after a volcanic eruption the lands were covered with ashes and many people were killed by the initial eruption or starved to death in the aftermath of the event. To ensure the survival of the ancient tribes in this region, the council of all tribes instated the law of reproduction. What the town celebrates today is the day for the gods and the women, who ensure the succession of their lineage.", "Festival of the Drink – Long long ago, a small group of dwarfs set out into the wilderness to establish a new outpost for the glory of their empire. When they finally settled down, they were quickly able to establish a secure outpost with plenty of food, but soon they realized they were missing one of the most important supplies of all. Alcohol. Without this necessity, order soon began unraveling in the fledgling outpost, until the lone brewer was forced to improvised. Facing no other choice, she ordered everybody to gather as much of any kind of fruit that they could find. Once the gathering was complete, she worked tirelessly for a week straight to make alcohol out of anything the other dwarfs had brought, churning out such strange brews such as cherry wine and plum cider. At the end of this massive burst of brewing brilliance, the anxiously waiting dwarfs were finally rewarded with the finest tasting drink they had ever tasted in their life. In remembrance, the now flourishing Dwarven outpost celebrates this event in it’s history by holding a festival every year where brewers compete to create the best brew possible from the local fruit chosen for that year.", "The Sun God Observation Day – On this day all the village observers the sun god. I.e. stare at the sun as long as possible. The people at the village do this because an old witch told them that it would prevent them from seeing the destruction of the village. Since everyone is mostly blind her prophecy seems to have come true.", "Wishmore Night – The city holds a festival at the docks, all walks of life are included and encouraged to mingle with each other. Everyone, either individually or in groups create floating wreaths in whatever way they want to present it. At midnight when the water is still, the leader of the city will wade out into the water and release their wreath first, as an offering to the gods. Everyone in turn will release theirs following the leadership, before returning to the festivities which will often go long into the next night. This celebration is to thank the gods for a bountiful year, or even a year of character building (in case of hard times). It is to mourn those lost in the Shipping routes and to pray for the safe return of others. If the water isn’t disturbed except for the wreaths, it is fabled to be a year of easy storms for the sailors. It is also of note that these wreaths never ever turn up anywhere else in the world. They disappear completely.", "Celebration of Destruction – The Nine Hells love the awakening of the tarrasque so much that they make it a festivity. The celebration comprises of feasting upon whatever the titan destroyed and watching it as it rampages through entire cities, leaving nothing but rubble and dead life of all varieties in its wake. After the gargantuan beast falls asleep once again, all of devil kind praise the strength and ferocity of the powerful tarrasque.", "Ale Day – A dwarven celebration that simply commemorates the invention of their favorite drink. It quickly spread to many other humanoid peoples. Dwarves and satyrs love it the most.", "Owlbear Memorial Day – Elven cities that use owlbears as defense use this day to give thanks to the beasts that have protected their land for decades, sometimes centuries. The whole town offers food of all kinds for the creatures below. It’s very easy to argue that the owlbears enjoy this day more than the elves above ever could.", "Festival of Life – A celebration of the Upper Planes where the denizens of the heavens celebrate the good in every creature of the Material Plane. Commonly occurs when large amounts of good, neutral, or unaligned creatures are born. This involves animals and humanoids alike. A huge feast is held with some of the most delicious food in existence.", "Day of the Arts – An elven celebration where every form of art is honored. For months before this day, humanoids all across the Material Plane prepare songs, plays, dances, paintings, sculptures, and many other forms of art. A favorite day for many satyrs, with many placing it right behind Ale Day in their lists. Bards of many peoples are particularly fond of this festival. Silver dragons also love to celebrate alongside the humanoids that have arrived.", "Beholder Day – A holiday invented by beholders to celebrate themselves. They give themselves presents, and demand that their servants get them presents or they die. If a cult has decided to worship the floating aberration, the beholder will only have to remind its worshipers once and it has a myriad of presents coming its way. Unlike normal holidays that occur annually, Beholder Day happens once every week.", "Cliffton Day – Cliffton was a local legend who long ago had defeated a demon water elemental which came upon the small fishing village of Mistwood. They celebrate his triumph every year with contests which correlate to what traits he was known for. Whoever wins any of the contests then participates in a final contest, the winner of which is given the title of “Aspect of Cliffton,” and is then invited to participate in a ceremonial recreation of the famous battle. They are given a costume and Cliffton’s old ax and told to strike down an effigy – a standing effigy of the demon is already in center of town, but underneath the rags which make up the costume is a bound man, the village drunk, being put to death without knowledge of the adventurers. Maybe now that the adventurer is close to the figure, they can hear strained breathing amidst the cheers and song of the villagers. If they refuse to complete the ceremony, the same water demon who attacked the town years ago rises from the nearby lake and threatens to destroy the town once again. As it turns out, the killing of a man in the ritually-prepared town square once a year is part of a ritual that keeps the demon at bay.", "The Betrothment Battle – Every year on the first weekend after the Summer solstice, the town plays host to a wrestling tournament and exhibition. Hand to hand fighters from across the realm come to the town to prove their mettle, and rings are prepared for non-tournament participants to settle small arguments that have built up over the year. Named for a famous fight in the town at the wedding of the Mayor’s son and one of the prominent merchant’s daughters that saw the merchant, the mayor and most of their families tear apart the public house, the tavern, and a stable in an hours long fight.", "The Wardens Gauntlet – In the spring the city’s best and brightest face each other in a series of physical and mental challenges. Some are complex rituals, puzzles and riddles testing mind and spirit. Others are tests of endurance, agility, and strength. Betting and boasts are a much enjoyed portion and the contests themselves are openly viewed by the public to cheer on their favorites. The top three are given the honorary title of Warden followed by celebration where the previous Wardens hand off the mantle to any new Wardens or retain their station from the previous year. These Wardens represent the common people in matters of ceremony and any concerns or grievances to the Crown and city councils until the next years contest. Being a warden is often the path to guild leaderships or council seats and even titles from the crown. The history behind the trials and celebrations is vaguely remembered from the time of city states when open warfare was avoided by settling issues between the Wardens of each city state. There was also a darker reason for the intricate rituals and ceremony. Now considered just a spiritual and mental exercise, they serve an unknown purpose strengthening ancient Runes and Spells against something truly horrific that is ever vigilant and hungry.", "Stabbing Day – Using fake daggers the populace honors the day a group of rouges saved the city from a dragon attack. It’s exactly what you think, expect red dye stains.", "Rom’Chuk – Local barbarian tribes meet together in an unfortunate city and hold a Dwarf tossing contest. Use of Gnomes with fake beards is extremely frowned upon.", "Siggi’s Birthday – A great shield maiden gave her life to save the city. Women can let anyone they are sweet on know by picking them up over their shoulders and hauling them off. Siggi wasn’t known for her subtlety. Rooms at the Inn are free in her honor.", "The Games – A week of festivities that include games of all types under the sun; from dexterity-tests like obstacle courses, to strength competitions such as log-tossing, and even an academia note to it, like a spellcaster’s competition. This week of fun was created some time ago when a tyrant ran the city with an iron fist. Once a year he would force his supplicants to participate in crazy games which usually ended in their death. Once he was overthrown, the citizens opted to keep the week of festivities, whilst removing the “death” part. It helped the community grow closer, keeping those with terrible ambitions out.", "The Pilgrimage – A day when every person in the city is expected to “carry their weight” and bring their greatest distress out in the open, so that their neighbors, friends and community may support them in earnest. Those who refuse to participate are exiled from the community until they complete a pilgrimage to the neighboring continent and bring back something that will actively make their community better; be it money, food, or magical wards. This is a practice from when the city was still just a fledgling town and every person needed to pull their own weight, and everyone relied on everyone else to support each other.", "Lottery Day – A crop fertility ritual where outsiders are encouraged to attend. Eventually someone is picked at sundown and stoned to death by the crowd. Do not take the raffle tickets they offer…but there are prizes afterwards.", "Day of the Horn – the ceremony draws in tieflings like moths to a flame. Almost hypnotized by the low droll of an ancient obsidian tiefling skull horn being played amongst the music. Dusk brings the climax of the festival where all the spirits of an ancient battle posses the revelers and show them an ancient battle where a contingent of tieflings rebelled against their fiend masters and joined with the townsfolk to drive the demons back to Hell. The leader selflessly gave her life to save her comrades and new friends by blowing a smoldering hole through the chests of no more than 15 fiends…leaving just her skull. “We Remember” is the mantra and afterwards the tieflings are thanked and cared for with the thought “We can be more than the sum of our parts”.", "Madel’s Star Day – A meteorite fell to form a crater where a town eventually sprang up. The 5 meter rock absorbs all hostile magic and steals any illusions. The soothing rhythmic glow is amazing to behold. Only a handful of elders have metal bracelets fashioned from the meteorite that allows them to cast spells in town. Only one new one is awarded every century. In town it allows for casting of spells, outside of town it has a chance to absorb a hostile one (even your own). The properties of the stone also royally mess with any Warforged that come into contact with it.", "Grey Snow Day – A volcanic instability in the area uncovered a ruined fiend city. Excavations uncovered ancient masks that the party goers wear. The volatile nature of the masks grant a limited form of fire manipulation after sun down. The party notices that a vague form of possession is slowly corrupting the crowd every year.", "Fomarath Day – Laurel and oak wreaths are adorned and offerings prepared for the four treefolk guardians in a nearby permanent druid grove. A group of Hill Giants were about to lay waste to a group of farmers when a druid and his party drove them off. The druid stayed behind for a year to make sure the spell would stick. The treefolk actually love the townsfolk and have attracted other peaceful sentient plants.", "Craghoof Moot – A nomadic band of centaurs and a nearby halfling settlement have a very intertwined history of one ancestor saving another or one group saving the other from invasion. The most noble thing a member could do is swear an oath to one another to ride together for a year and a day protecting the territory. The amount of high grade alcohol and mead available is mind boggling. Watching halflings in war paint and centaurs in straw hats and vests is quite hilarious.", "The Druid Chain festival – As a last ditch protection against incursions into this dimension three druids, twelve elementals, and three dragons can unite and merge for a primordial ritual called a Gaia Chain to drag whatever horror that threatens all existence into the maw of the planet itself trapping it within the molten core for all eternity. It kills all those involved and as such the three temple locations became holy places to all forms of life. It is the raw elemental fury and power of the first ones that saved the world are remembered in giant soul crystals that once a year show the images of these lost heroes.", "Broken Toy Day – Warforged holiday marking their Independence.", "The Anniversary of The Great Mayhem – Recalls the day tribe of barbarians, orcs, and goblins laid absolute waste to a city of necromancers, warlocks, and wizards.", "Eeling – every autumn as the eel population in the local reservoir grows too great, the Swanmay invite the local village to come and collect as many as they can stock for the year. While fresh eel is on the menu, the festival itself is a community occupation, jarring eels, processing oil from them and otherwise making sure that what they want will keep until next year. Large communal tables are set up in the town square and the locals gather early to get a place at the centre most tables where gossip and ale flow strongest.", "Digging High – At summer solstice the various dwarven families of the area come to The Kin Hole, where they will mine as one for the three days of the festival. The hole itself is barren of valuable minerals, but the myth that the families’ ancestors divined great wealth for all dwarven kind at its completion still exists. While much merriment is made by the dwarves, the presence of outsiders is an immediate dampener.", "Gluttony – though not a festival per se, the first two months of the year are always eagerly anticipated by the hobbi… the halflingses of Portree. The tradition of the wealthier houses organising lavish bashes during the time as a means of canvassing has replaced a very loose sense of meritocratic governance with a very enthusiastic intoxicracy.", "The Quiet – in the old days, the village of Pertiv was in a most precarious position. Early settlers had grouped to farm an area which they only later realised was threatened by orcs, owlbears and darker things from below. While everyone celebrates the heroes who saved the village all those years ago rambunctiously in Spring, in late autumn the people remember the early days of fear and salvation by drinking heavily together in silence. Any but the most necessary and cursory communication is looked down on, and there are those in the village old enough to remember those times from their childhood.", "Fyre – The burning of the Winter Witch. They say that the Winter Witch (who is the spirit of winter) is dull and dreary, but can be driven away with humor and merriment. Villagers celebrate by erecting bonfires and once the sun touches the horizon they are set alight. They drink mulled wine, play games in the snow and sing crude songs to drive the Winter Witch away.", "Grimm – Orcish first blood ritual. An orc is a child until they are blooded, among the more civilized tribes of orcs this takes place in a festival called Grimm. Those deemed worthy or are brazen enough to try form a Wog or raiding party then a suitable target is chosen usually small Kobold warren or goblin outpost. All participants must bring back a heart for Grummush (their god) and a head to prove their prowess.", "Spring Break Wizard Demolition Derby – A popular beachside town is inundated by hundreds to thousands of student and apprentice wizards from several large nearby schools out on holiday break. The wizards inevitably form carousing groups, get absolutely sloshed, and then try to show off their spells to intimidate rival schools, impress potential dates, or simply cause chaos. In order to keep the wizards out of town proper and redirect the damage, the town sets up beer gardens, bathrooms, dirt cheap “inns”, and other sacrificial establishments on the beach. The student wizards naturally make it their goal to destroy absolutely every temporary structure they can, culminating in a massive destruction derby on the final night. Meanwhile, the city residents cower and hope the dispatched army can keep them from invading and burning down the town, again.", "Spring Break Playwright Championship – A popular beachside town is inundated by hundreds to thousands of student and apprentice bards from several large nearby schools out on holiday break. The bards inevitably form carousing groups, get absolutely sloshed, and then try to outdo the acts of rival schools, impress potential dates, or simply make a name for themselves. In order capitalize on their creative output and increase tourism, the town builds temporary theaters on the beach. The student bards naturally make it their goal to claim the most audience. Students create original productions in several different categories, marching band, full orchestra, historical drama, tragic opera, comedy musical, dance, etc. and debut them head to head against rival groups from all the different schools. The one who captures the most audience wins. On the final night, all the student bards join together for an all night jam session.

(Free alcohol is often used to bait audience members.)", "Spring Break Ascetic Training Festival – A popular mountain town is inundated by hundreds of student and apprentice monks who jogged hundreds of miles to sit under cold waterfalls made of fresh snowmelt. The monks tend to be fairly orderly since this location is a prime spot to focus one’s ki and discover new techniques. Some waterfalls have better reputations than others, so the student monks will challenge each other for superior meditation spots. The poor fasting students monks tend not to bring much revenue, but tourists who want to watch them fight do. The town constructs several “arenas” sculpted from natural materials with silenced stands so the monks are not disturbed in their combat or meditation.

Some more enterprising monks also do demonstrations or offer basic self-defense classes to tourists.", "The Bathing – Held at the height of summer.

About 1/3 of the city’s population will meet in the square every 3-4 hours during daylight, and only once after nightfall.

This came about as a defense from a siren who once lured too many of the city’s capable workers during a particularly hard summer.

The community can ask for something in return, or nothing at all. No guarantee of a request being honored, even with payment given.

The base measures about 60ft across, but the peak 3,000ft up is easily a mile across. Stairs may have been carved into the side, but the climb down to the summit (or is it up to the base? The locals aren’t quite sure) is precarious at times. The locals are also similarly vague when asked about what’s on top…", "Worried stones – A group of 3 standing stones with anxiety. When encountered in their clearing, they will disappear once all eyes are off them. Careful inspection will reveal them to hiding nearby – peeking from behind a nearby tree, bottom of a lake, hidden by bushes, behind where the party is now looking, etc. If discovered, they disappear again if not observed. The stones are not malicious, and do not harm the party. They would just rather you all left them to it, thank you.", "The Quiet Creek – An otherwise ordinary creek that runs through a forest.

All along its course stand small boulders, almost fully grown over with moss.", "The Shifting Hills – A large field of hills, dotted with rocks, grasses, and flowers. Careful study has found the hills are constantly moving, as though old creatures crawl along under a carpet of earth. Magics which call upon the earth always seem to produce unexpected results when among them.", "The Devil’s Wager – A large disc shaped stone at the base of a long dormant volcano. Visitors toss a copper at it for good luck. There are a couple hundred copper around it.

The current residents have not attempted to mine, excavate, or even explore the pit, so they don’t know why this location was chosen to build when the town was founded.", "Shellfish Bay – a small fishing village on the edge of an untamed wilderness. It’s a picturesque place – blue ocean, sand beach, up against dark trees and thick undergrowth, but travellers and adventurers frequently avoid it due to its reputation. Some curse affects the inhabitants – they are slow-witted and short-lived, rarely living past their 30s, and everyone who lives there is affected by it after a time. Many people have tried to help the cursed village, but they’ve all missed the true, mundane cause – mercury buildup from their steady diet of shellfish, and lead poisoning in the water.", "Andrea Gail – A small desert community built around a shipwreck. No one seems to know how the ship got here. Legend says that t was caught in a giant storm that lifted it out of the sea. Others say it was a giant wave. Either way the original sailors had obviously angered some god. Many people live inside of the ship, including the mayor who lives in the former captain’s quarters. There are also some tents and makeshift shelters around the ship.", "Icefark – A relatively small city, cursed with eternal winter and dark skies. The inhabitants are pretty chill, though it’s known that the government is always spying on them, and keeps making problematic people disappear.", "Trigemnlow – A city with two floors – one above the surface and one below.

Named for its long main road that cuts the town in half, and acts as a bulwark between the civilized human lands and the savage Orc Natives. Unknown to the townsfolk, Longstreet sits close to a cache of ancient wonders of a bygone age.", "Tal’ Vellar (Skyhold): Long ago, a clan of dwarves were forced into exile from their homes and forced to wander the surface, searching for a new home. A young Noble of the house found and rescued a wounded griffon, which (the legends say) carried him back to the griffon aerie, high up on the cliffs of Mount Targud. There the Dwarf found a series of shallow caves. He returned and led his clan back up the cliffs and established Tal’Vellar. Clan Norkaidrumm, the Cloud-Tamers, all descend from this clan. Tal’Vellar is all but inaccessible to uninvited guests. Those who approach from the ground must make their way up perilous, winding trails with steep ascents; those coming from the sky must find their way through the thick clouds surrounding it. More dangerous still are the clan’s halberdier guards, who ride their griffon mounts with unparalleled skill. Anyone who is allowed in, however, discovers the wonder of the Caves Above The Clouds. Perhaps most notable in this is the Sunforge, a large crystal carefully positioned and enchanted so as to catch solar rays and focus them down for forging. Powerful magic weapons are made here (even rarer are the Lunarforged items, possible to work only during a full moon). The Cloud Dwarves, for their part, are strange mirrors of their earthbound cousins, notable for their light-blue eyes and fair skin and hair. Although standoffish and isolationist, the clan can be roused to assist in helping those below, and may sometimes be seen serving as aerial mercenaries for good-aligned armies.", "The Scaffolds – When the great Sorcerer-King Atravarius attempted-and failed-his quest towards deification, his empire crumbled and was destroyed in a single night and day. One of the few remaining remnants was the colossal bronze statue he was having built of himself in his capital of Atravia; standing over 400 feet tall, the great statue represented the might of Atravarius. The unfinished statue miraculously survived the Great Upheaval, even as the great city around it simultaneously burned and drowned. Many of the workers sought refuge in the scaffolding scattered around the statue; as most other buildings were smashed to rubble, they remained there, building living spaces in the labyrinth of rooms inside the statue and establishing a society safe from the wandering monsters and marauders. A large of contingent of the workers had been Kenku, and they took naturally to living in the ramshackle scaffolds, precariously set high in the air. Today, the Scaffolds are a warren of closely packed buildings and thin walkways, surrounding the bronze skeleton of a long-dead king. While many of the original denizens have moved to other cities, the city remains a common retreat for those seeking shelter, or to disappear.", "Potabello – This serene halfling town is built on top of an impossibly large lily pad; the pad covers a good two thirds of the lake it is on. Three bridges connect Potabello to the shore, and the town’s denizens happily fish for giant tadpoles off the edges. No one has seen a giant frog there in fifty years, so where the tadpoles come from- and where they go if not caught- is somewhat of a mystery…", "Lantern – A small town buried deep in the forest. It might seem odd to name a town after a lantern but it is well earned. Due to the surrounding hills and forest growth, the town practically never sees any direct sunlight. Early settlers created hundreds of magical lanterns that continuously cast Dancing Lights, giving the town streets an enchanting look at all hours. A small river winds its way through the town to help give its residents natural water and resources. The river adds to the lovely view as it reflects the lights.", "Cliffwatch – the only village on the Island of Whispered Regrets, Cliffwatch is all but invisible when approached by land. The deeply overhanging cliffs that give the village it’s name are also host to a forest of enormous trees. Their incredibly dense roots, enhanced with some judiciously applied elvish magic, have allowed the village to form on the underside of the cliffs. While there are secret routes from the village to the top of the island, almost all visitors arrive by sea, sailing into the well-sheltered harbor that sits directly below Cliffwatch. At night, the bridges and windows of the village shine brightly, though they are eclipsed easily by the powerful Cliffwatch Beacon, a magically fueled lighthouse built into the end of the longest taproot of the trees above.", "Fungosillo – A small, seemingly friendly oasis town in the middle of the desert where cooking, eating or damaging a small, unassuming and common brown mushroom with white spots that grows exclusively in the inside of its walls is forbidden and highly penalized… in secret. The reclusive mayor is a puppet of a Cordyceps-like myconid, who acts as a ‘protector’ (more like an extortionist) and keeps the townsfolk sacrifice to a minimum as long as they kidnap the occasional traveler in their sleep and provide them as an offering to the underground fungi colony.", "New Talyport – a magical city, which require outsiders to fulfill one requirement for entrance. A magic item will cut off their left hands and preserve them in jars.

A place populated by bandits and thieves, killers and assassins, Skum has one, ironclad law; never deal your fellow residents raw. Allegiance to that single rule makes the town, if not peaceful, a place that is much safer than its reputation would suggest. Unless, that is, someone’s coming to the town with a writ, or a badge. Those things will get you strung up at the crossroads as an example to other do-gooders and bounty hunters that Skum is not a place for them.", "Marabo’or – A fairly new coastal town of half-constructed houses with canvas and net walls and roofs, sandy roads, and an overall feel of growth. The town’s known for being a rising shipping hub, built at an ideal local between two trade hotspots. A renovated and remodeled shipwreck in the center of town serves as the town hall, where each of the 12 districts (specializing in different products/purposes) sends representatives to make laws. However, tensions rise between the districts when a threat to the town is fast approaching. Will the fledgling Marabo’or survive this, or collapse into anarchy?", "The Crannogs: A series of artificial islands in a shallow lake, known for its abundant freshwater clam beds prized as delicacies. Both bridges and canals connect the numerous small islands. The old families are often in dispute over each other and bridges have been known to be taken down and reassembled elsewhere to make a point about shifting alliances. Lately the clam yields have been dropping despite no changes to the collecting methods. At the same time, the clam rakes have begun to bring up bones and old rusty bits of armor and weapons with strange runes. A digger known to be a strong swimmer was observed being sucked underwater after he went in the lake to retrieve a dropped tool.", "Savlok – A town built suspended underneath a large natural stone arch. The upper class live in towers built up the suspension system of the town. The town’s poor live in hovels 200ft down below on the ground floor where waste and broken things are tossed carelessly.", "Webrock Canyon- this town sits on stone bridges connecting one cliff’s edge to another. These bridges are little more than errant strips of stone that, when viewed from above look like a spider web. The brave souls that live here live on platforms suspended over the cavern and connected by rope bridges. Most of them make a living by ferrying items across the canyon, but others collect water and fish from the bottom of the canyon by suspending buckets from rope. Others still try to mine from the sides of the mountain, but there is a debate going on as to whether or not this could endanger the town.", "Camanchaca – this town is situated on the bottom side of a cloud, and has a reverse gravity enchantment on it.

Many of them also have an understanding of divination and history not seen outside of universities due to their extensive experience with spirits.", "The City of Whistling Glass- this town sits in what used to be Thri-Keen tunnels before a blue dragon electrified their lair for offending her. When she dragged out the remains, it looked like limbs of a great glass tree. A gnomish town now sits in its ‘shade’. When the desert breeze reaches it’s trunk it makes a dull whistle that gives the town it’s namesake. The townspeople use the reflected light of the sun in order to create charged, radiant lanterns that they use as batteries.", "Saltpoint – A seaside village complete with a large set of docks and lots of fisherman. The townsfolk are quite paranoid about the woods to the north and refuse to get any resources from there. They get all they need from the sea. (The buildings are all scrapped together with driftwood or parts of boats).", "Crow’s Nest – A village on an island built entirely in the guts of a very large and very ruined ship. The ‘Lower Decks’ house the lower echelons of society and the wealth grows as you go up the wooden structure of the boat.

An aqueduct extends from the mountain into the town supplying it with water. It is widely known that this town is under the control and protection of an ancient blue dragon that lairs deeper in the desert.

A field of floating scrap metal, debris, and garbage surrounds the ship for a few miles. The field is thick enough to walk on within a few miles, but hazardous with occasional thin spots and sharp debris. Within the immediate vicinity of the ship the debris is thick enough that some have been able to construct structures on it, making a shantytown.", "Lobersmuth – A town built by criminals for criminals, it sits on the edge of a swamp. No building has a name on the outside, and the streets are deliberately labyrinthine. Any who look lost or ask for directions are immediately marked as outsiders and potential targets.", "Maurkin – A town in the midst of a great and vast dark wood, the quaint town of Maurkin is under the rule of Night Prophetess Damis. She has taught the people necromancy, allowing them to stay inside and study while the undead help work the fields. Special care is given to keep the streets vermin-free, and the people will take special interest in people who have corpses to give, as spare bodies tend to be hard to come by. The Night Prophetess Damis is actually a middling necromancer named Chrysanthemum. She’s a good person at heart, and a possible love interest if the PCs are cool with dating the effective ruler of a town of necromancers.", "The prison fortress of Hollow Hands lies in a tucked away valley where the weave of magic does not touch the world. This fortress is home to the powerful mages that have become enemies of the empire. Despite the menacing presence of the fortress, the town’s unique anti-magic property has attracted an interesting crowd of locals, many of who believe that they have a ‘Magic Allergy’ and moved here for the sake of their health.", "Tranca – Small port trade city ran by Jerrod the One-eyed. He runs the town with ruthless efficiency, but he never overstepped in tyranny. As with all ports, you see various folk on the streets and in the docks, as well as variety of goods. The town is home to Sapphire Masters, a group of smiths, and undergraduate wizards who discovered how to infuse steel with some level of magic, making them only ones in the realm who can reliably create +1 weapons and armor.", "Domos Negros – A village of farmers in the middle of a desert plateau, who obtain water for their crops by absorbing the humidity of the mist that forms at night through the material from which their constructions are made: some domes of the darkest black one can imagine.", "Old Hallows – This city was built by a group of adventures over the site of a Vampiric cult’s unholy cathedral. Legends foretold the return of the cult’s powerful Vampire leader, the terrible Sarr’gethal Moncreft. The adventurers swore that they and their descendants after them would serve as guardians against Moncreft’s return. As such, the city is built with great layers of hallowing mixed into the very foundation. The streets are crafted from marble and laid out in holy sigils; the dead are cremated, their ashes blessed and spread in the Field of Martyrs. Powerful white walls surround the city, with fields of fire shaped into the earth to provide for protection from attack. The careful preparation led to Moncreft’s return being one of the most anticlimactic events of the age; no sooner did his spirit congeal into the material plane then he was trapped in a divine forcecage, separated into three parts, and sealed into three different airtight casks filled with holy water. One cask remains stored in the Old Hallows museum; the other two have been hidden. The city’s primary task completed, it now stands as a bastion of good and a source of great heroes.", "Syom’skit-Ngthefl – Legend says that this gnomish town was purposefully named to be difficult to pronounce, so that outsiders would feel unwelcome. True or not, the gnomes of the area tend to be gruff and standoffish, with seemingly little interest in trade or news of the outside world. How such a place continues to thrive is a mystery.", "The Grinders – A human city built atop a Dwarven guard post, The Grinders is situated to defend Fourwater Pass against Orcish invasion from the Hungry Wilds. Prospering due to its location, the city is increasingly fat, corrupt, and poorly defended, depending on its impressive walls and its history of success. The Orcish hordes have been relatively silent in the last three decades; recently, however, there have been more and more incursions, with signs of a more unified force behind them. Rumor has it that the city is still protected by incredible Dwarven traps and defenses; however, the nearby Dwarven stronghold of Kry’thish has been increasingly cool to their human neighbors, taking a poor view of the local government. As a great invasion seems increasingly imminent, the help of the Dwarves may become vital to the city’s survival…", "Nahppa – A town located on two levels, straddling the great Nah Falls. The fish caught in the falls are a local delicacy, famous for their bright purple color. The locals love to tell fishing stories; however, the nature of the falls actually makes fishing relatively simple.", "The City of Quiet- Founded as a home for the deaf of the Elven Moch’arinin peoples, Quiet is located on top of a hill with a great view out onto the ocean. Although there is a number of non-deaf now living there, the city is still mostly silent, with communication via hand-signs.", "Gauthflame- a town nestled next to a series of craggy hills, Gauthflame is ruled over by Zybaxtrees, a copper dragon masquerading as a red one. Zybaxtrees receives a relatively lenient tax from the local residents, and protects the town from threats. He has been carrying on the masquerade for generations, partly for protective purposes, partly as a long-term prank. He finds himself very clever, and isn’t overly anxious to not be found out by adventurers; however, he makes them promise not to tell the townsfolk.", "Weneelomi – This small town lies on the outskirts of a much larger Elven university. Here, buildings are constructed to test the elves’ latest architectural styles. As a result, the various styles all at once can be overwhelming for new visitors.", "Elysia – This ice town is located in the middle of a desert where ice never melts. An old frost giant artifact holds it together.", "Dunclaver – This old logging town is run by dwarves located on the edge of Growers Forest. The forest magically grows back every week what the loggers cut, no one knows how or why but if not cut back the forest slowly creeps into the town.", "Clanoothyn – this small town clings to the precarious slopes of a valley, its buildings straggling along a rough winding road that follows the edge of a vast lake. A century before, Clanoothyn was a bustling farming community surrounding the river on the fertile valley floor, but a century ago, an unknown disaster in the mines caused a vast landslide: the entire north side of the valley slipped down and blocked the valley gorge so that bit by bit the valley flooded. Today, the only remnant of Old Clanoothyn is the topmost story of the old Wizard’s Tower still jutting defiantly upwards from beneath the waters.", "Rooskey – A small human settlement on the borders of the Night Forest; always surprisingly cold. The people there open their homes to visitors; it is customary to leave money or something of value in response, but it is rude to speak of pricing.", "Bricabrac- No one is sure where the portal comes from. Floating some 45 feet above the ground, the large floating rift opens periodically, emptying the contents onto the pile below. It seems likely that the society on the other side of the portal is highly magically advanced, and using the portal as a garbage disposal- although the leavings are a pile of detritus, enough magic items and valuable effects come through the portal to allow the denizens of the nearby town of Bricabrac to make a living scavenging through the junk. The process is not without peril, however; not only are there natural dangers and thrown-away traps, but sometimes the things being thrown away are still alive…", "Dismal Hollow – A small village located in a swamp, in which the buildings and walkways are built atop stilts so the structures sit just atop the water. The town is home to a small handful of humans and was originally settled as a military outpost. To the west, where the swamp meets the edge of a sacred forest, a tribe of wood elves protect the edge of their forest home from outsiders and are not happy that Dismal Hollow grows in size and population every year. However, both the humans and the elves have a centipede demon and its bug demon children to worry about as the demons devour everything in their path and is quickly bearing down on both civilizations.", "Louchitaine – a large town built in a gigantic mangrove forest. Warm, humid, and wonderfully fragrant, Louchitaine exists in a sun dappled twilight even on the brightest of it’s tropical days. The town is a hub for travellers passing by, as well as a popular tourist and vacation destination. While people of every shape, size, and race can be found there, it’s original denizens are a race of Fruitbat Folk (Generally lawful neutral, stats as Aarakocra with darkvision and an aversion to bright light). They are generally friendly, but almost every member of the Folk knows someone who knows someone who is involved in the organized crime cabals that run the town, or is active in those circles themselves. Louchitaine is a great town to get lost in for a while, but if you wander too far into it’s shadier groves, you might never leave.", "Yojimboq – built on a fortified island not too far off the coast, Yojimboq is known for whaling, unfriendly fisherpersons of every race, face, and creed, and for it’s rats. The island’s windy hills and craggy landscape has a dense and intractable rat population. Rats the size of cows prowl the landscape, hunting one another for food, fighting for mates and competing for resources and refuges. Smaller rats are everywhere, feasting on washed up seafood, insects, and the occasional unwatched child. Yojimboq has high walls protecting it from the local fauna, but raiding parties go out weekly to keep the overall rat population to almost manageable levels. An open bounty exists for any rat catchers who wish to bring back heads for gold. Their nearest neighbors on the coast (referred to locally and derisively as ‘Coasties’) have no idea why in the gods name people choose to live there. Residents are fiercely protective and proud of their town, and will defend it’s honor from any slight.", "Old Whizz’s Tower – Old Whizz’s Tower is just that – an old wizards tower. At some point in the past, the wizard residing in it must have decided that they wanted to see more of the world, and commanded his tower to travel around from place to place. The tower did so, and floats gently around the continent a height of about 50 feet. Eventually, the wizard either passed on or moved out, but the tower still wanders around. Enterprising individuals determined that objects lashed to the tower would also levitate, so long as they were properly attached. A shanty town has been cobbled together, with the old tower at it’s core, providing both levitation and an uncanny amount of foundational support for the wandering town. Shops, a tavern, and a hotel are the main features, with a town hall being held occasionally in the old tower itself. Whenever Old Whizz’s Tower encounters an obstacle of any real size, it will float gently out of the way, though punters (think towns guard with extensible enchanted polls) will occasionally help it on it’s way, or steer it in a more favorable direction.", "Menagerie – Once, ages ago, an old queen lived in a great castle. Her pride and joy was a menagerie, home to wondrous beasts, birds, and all manner of creatures. She loved every one, and would delight in visiting each, and making sure it had a more than adequate habitat to reside in. Eventually the queen passed, and the menagerie continued to be taken care of by her loving family and servants. Over time, others moved near by to visit the site. Some brought families. Eventually, a town grew out of the old castle, taking care of the incredible creatures contained within, and occasionally harvesting food, ingredients and other supplies to sell to other towns or apothecaries. The Menagerie is still active today.", "Daleberg – A small town, named after it’s arrogant and pompous founder, Dale. The townsfolk seem completely normal, but each has chosen to pronounce a different word incorrectly, with the exception of Dale, who is slowly losing their mind. A DC 20 investigation check reveals that this is actually all intentional – a prank by the townsfolk on their insufferably mayor. A fund has been set up to whomever has the most ludicrous mispronunciation of that week, and another, much larger fund has been set up for whomever finally gets Dale to break. The mayor is becoming increasingly ill tempered, and a high enough charisma role after passing the DC 20 investigation check will have the townsfolk invite you to join in on the joke. Fireworks will ensue.", "Craighoof – A halfling settlement that has a symbiotic relationship with the neighboring centaur tribes. They drove off an Orcish invasion ages ago and averted a famine at the same time. Farms and orchards dot the landscape along with tall trees that have difficult to reach fruit. Scouts from each group band together for up to a year to patrol the perimeters.", "Storm Reach – A town built on a plateau in the shadow of a basalt cliff, Storm Reach is high enough to be easily defended from the dangers of the forests below. However, it’s exposed to the raging thunders that circle the peaks, and its walls stand against the high winds that could otherwise sweep one right over the side.", "Umberdale – A town that has been completely taken under control of a mind flayer. It has feasted on their brains and replaced them with an Intellect Devourer. The people act strange and unusual. Elderly farmers are able to carry what looks to be double their weight. Children run stores along with adults and even the pets can be seen as intelligent (walking on back legs, cooking food with fire).", "Afsthen’s Peak – an independent agrarian town situated in one of the least hospitable mountain ranges in the world. The mountain of Afsthen is so tall that a third of it rests comfortably above the clouds at all times, eternally blanketed in snow. Yet a monumental hot spring graces the caldera where its peak should be, and it hosts an island in its northwest with surprisingly fertile soil. Here resides the town. Neighboring kingdoms are unwilling or unable to claim the town, since any army would be worn down by the inhospitable flanks of the mountain range. This suits the insular Afsthenei fine- they have little need for traders and no need for laws made by people they’ve never seen nor heard of. There are less than two thousand Afsthenei, all told, mostly human, but with some immigrants who have fled up the peaks, or immigrated in order to pursue a simpler life. They raise goats and other hardy livestock, as well as a few crops adapted to the rarified air, but at such an altitude they can’t grow any trees. For wood, the men of the village descend past the clouds and beneath the tree line during the warmest summer days to spend much of their time logging. The wood is stockpiled in cyclopean warehouses for use the rest of the year.", "Wading Helm – miles out to sea, the top of a titanic humanoid’s head just barely peaks above the waves. Clad in armor, the decomposed remains of this ancient being continue to move, as it walks a somewhat elliptical path across the southern seabed. Wading Helm is a shantytown built atop it, made from imported stones and wood. Tethered boats are dragged behind the titan’s head like hair drifting in the water. Fishing is plentiful, as the movement of the colossus drives up vast clouds of nutrient-rich particles from the seafloor and brings schools of fish. Whaling nets them bone for scrimshawing and other artistic purposes. Wading Helm exports a variety of exotic waxes, soaps, and oils, made by mixing seafloor particulate with tallow and some other secret ingredients. Of course, they also trade away more conventional fish and marine mammal byproducts. Most of its population is away on trading fleets, which may take months to reach their destinations. Due to the shifting location of their homeland, Wadehelmers have honed the ability to read the sky and waves to know where they are.", "Kormaring is an exquisite town. The roads are paved with scintillating glass flagstones. The four soapstone outer walls are painted red to match the leaves of the stripped-bark maples, and the gates are adorned with flowering vines. Fountains at the center of each crossroads in this square-shaped town each hold a large, perfectly reflective, silvery ball about as wide as a man’s chest. The inner walls of each building are lined with pink halite. The city itself has four-fold symmetry, with a large temple dominating its center. The temple, though roofed, remains open to the elements by virtue of not having doors for its wide doorways. The halfling and gnomish citizens ensure the candles at the center altar are lit, and carry out the rituals depicted on carefully preserved banners that used to flutter from the temple arches. But no one knows who originally built the city, or why the modern-day citizens are compelled to carry out the temple rituals.", "Dahruul’s Gate – the center of information commerce for the land, Dahruul’s gate is the largest artificing town around. Built into an ancient basin, it also does commerce with the Underdark, with the local mind flayers being willing to trade information. In addition, it has removed the death penalty in a large area around it. Death is seen as a waste of mind, body, and soul, of which there is a thriving market for all three for various purposes. Dahruul’s also boasts some of the finest medical technology money can buy, as well as a relatively low crime rate. Criminals have become very profitable for the city, as they can sell the person four ways. Alive, as a slave. Their body, as an undead slave or medical specimen, their soul as a power source, and their brain as ‘flayer food.", "The Bubble – Created to protect an ancient artifact, this city is found on the ocean floor in the crystal clear waters of a bay. The magical tome locked away in the cities vault creates a large bubble in the water, protecting all those inside. The only way into this city is through an underground tunnel that takes you to the edge of the town. While all are welcomed, this city is mostly inhabited by water genasi.", "Hagshead Rock – A small village placed on the edge of a large peat bog. The villagers harvest the stingweed berries that grow in the bog and make a variety of tart jams and jellies, as well as a heady wine. No one knows where the town’s name comes from.", "The Lichus – A bustling trade town located above a group of natural caverns. The town has grown up from nothing within the last 10 years, and has a reputation for great sales and impressive hospitality. This growth is, in fact, due largely to a powerful Otyugh wizard, Mungri, who lives in the caverns below the town and feeds off the offal and refuse from the town and the caravans who frequent it. Mungri’s unusual brilliance has also increased his telepathic range, which allows him to ‘nudge’ the residents to improve their work, and visitors to feel welcome.", "Groveler’s Knob – An impoverished farming village, or at least what’s left of one. For the past several years, every few months a recurring plague has most of the men in bed with fever and strange orange dots covering their faces and necks. The women aren’t affected but they’re too busy ministering to the ill to tend to the fields. The plague only lasts about a ten-day, and there’s no lasting effects, but it has the local economy in a tizzy.", "Pali – Built halfway up the side of a deep jungle canyon, Pali offers its citizens protection on two fronts. First, it is difficult for the jungle beasts or other would-be invaders to reach the village without using the well-known – and well-guarded – pathways up the cliff. Second, a massive spider maintains a thick web across the top of the canyon, creating a tricky barrier against any aerial assaults. The spider – which was living here long before Pali was established – doesn’t seem to pay any attention to the village, but the remains that drop to the canyon floor when it cleans its web occasionally provide the villagers with some very interesting resources.", "Giizlunrik – “Desert Dwarf’s Dark Draught: An Oasis in Each Drop. Brewed in the Town of Giizlunrik.” This ale can only be found in more upscale taverns, so it’s always a welcome surprise to see Desert Dwarf’s sunset logo on a barrel behind the barkeep. Venturing out to the legendary town of Giizlunrik is a journey undertaken by only the most passionate of drink connoisseurs, for it really is in the middle of the desert. Upon arrival, such pilgrims are caught by surprise, as the town seemingly consists of a shack and a signpost reading “Cheers, and Welcome to Giizlunrik.” Upon entry to the shack, because what other option is there, it becomes apparent that the town is entirely underground. Whoops. These are dwarves, after all. These dwarves not only make a mean brew, they also give fantastic brewery tours and sell top-grade brewer’s kits! Any and all travelers leave the town grinning, with a sunset-logoed travel flagon attached to their packs.", "Ald Yock- For some inexplicable reason, the denizens of Ald Yock have no knowledge of the outside world. The townsfolk are aware that the outside world exists, of course; however, they show no interest in anything foreign, and quickly forget anyone not a resident of the town. Thus, even someone who comes back again and again every year will be a stranger each time they arrive, with any previous actions attributed to ‘one of you outsiders.’ Unfortunately, this lack of consequence has led many to view the town as a place to act without license; as a result, the townsfolk view visitors with suspicion and distaste.", "Hommshome – Barely more than a hamlet, Hommshome would be beneath notice if it were not for the Matraine family. The Matraines, hardy farming stock, ran into monetary difficulties after a spate of illnesses. In order to aid the family, three of the Matraine sons set out to make a fortune adventuring; within a year, the Matraine Brothers were some of the realm’s greatest heroes, and Hommshome has benefited from the treasure they sent back.", "Thromarch – Formed by The Handmen of The Glorified Chalice, a utopian society. The Handmen believed that a glorified anarcho-socialist form of government was destined to be successful; thus, when the city failed, it failed spectacularly. Thromarch survived the resulting food riots, but has still not recovered from its losses.", "Fangel’s Stacks – A city comprised of mines, forges, and hot air balloons. Originally a mining community, the abundance of coal caused a large number of blacksmiths to move into the residential sections of the mine during it’s early days. With the rapidly expanding population, the smoke and heat eventually became unbearable. As a solution, the Smith’s began boring shafts from the surface down to their smithies. Over time, build up from the smoke formed stalagmite-like columns around the holes, which have to be cleaned regularly to prevent closure. The older the forge, the bigger the stack was. Once their size began to be seem as a symbol of prestige, it was only a matter of time until some smiths began to artificially increase the size of their stacks and label them with crests as a form of advertisement to traders approaching the city. In recent years an enterprising architect and engineer began building a network of hot air balloon structures above the stacks. The heat venting out of the stacks keeps this small aerial district afloat but a few accidents has prevented a large number of people and businesses from moving to the floating latticework of canvas and wood.", "Thrafitt – Originally a penal colony for the large city of Haworthy, Thrafitt is located on an island with large, imposing cliffs about three miles from the mainland. When gold sand was found on Thrafitt’s northern shore, it quickly became a boomtown.", "Downwater – bordered on the West by salt flats, Downwater was erected around a cavernous waterhole with no visible floor. The buildings are made mostly of wood, with stonemasonry reserved for the foundations and skeleton of more important buildings. The dusty streets are wide open and salted seasonally to prevent local poisonous plants from growing. Salt scraping and mining provide most of the town’s jobs. The sinkhole used to be filled with drinkable water, but its water level began dropping a few years back and now it’s impossible to see the water line from the surface. A lengthy, rickety pipe system has been constructed to siphon the water up.", "Stag Run – named for the event that helped settlers discover this place, Stag Run is built on a season-sensitive freshwater swamp and is adjacent to multiple small river tributaries. Fruits, nuts, fish, and meat are in abundance, and the town produces a marvelously sweet cheese. Most of Stag Run is protected from visibility due to the thick vegetation and lack of easily identifiable landmarks. However, the poor soil makes farming only possible at the outskirts of the town, in open sight of those traveling the rivers or forest roads. In addition to its cheese, Stag Run is also notable for its ‘friendly’ monkeys and the beautiful pearl vines, whose flowers open in response to moonlight.", "The Ruts – a trade stop built atop the buried remains of an old city. Many of its larger roads were excavated at some point in order to erect storm shelters. Scapegraces and adventurous souls use the uncharted passageways between these ‘ruts’ to go where they want undetected. Many of the modern structures are made of adobe. The Ruts exports clay pottery and hemp fiber, paint, and paper, as well as sandstone and granite in bulk from its quarries.", "Ahsju – erected on the terraces of a fertile mountain, the ancient Ahsjans used powerful earth-shaping magics to erect mountainside dams. In spite of erosion and gravity, the bowl-shaped structures they created jut out the sides of the mountain today. The waterfalls produced by divots in the dam walls during heavy rains are so long they cast rainbows before hitting the ground. The town itself reveres the dams, and uses these large reservoirs of fresh water to feed their humongous fields.", "Krayax – sheltered from sharp northern winds by cloud-scraping cliffs, Krayax is surrounded on all other sides by sloping chaparral. The land is only good for onion farming and agave harvests, and the nearest river is miles away, so it seems like there would be little reason to found a town here. The citizens receive most of their supplies from wizard consortiums through a magical gate. The town itself is close to a major nexus of leylines, from which its gate draws energy; it is founded atop a vault that contains artifacts of great power and evil, and the Krayaxian people train specialized Honorguard to patrol and protect the vault.", "Sychone – A town where nobody trusts anybody and everyone has their own crackpot conspiracy theories about something or other. Turns out the drinking water’s got traces of drugs that are known to destroy peoples’ mental states.", "Higpace – An enormous 50-floor tower that is entirely economically independent. The bottom 15 floors are residential, the next 10 are recreational, the next 10 are industrial and shopping, the next 20 are devoted to farming and supplying food, and the top 5 floors are governmental. It’s a relatively nice city and it’s surprisingly sturdy, though there’s only one elevator, so a lot of the time you’ll have to use the stairs if you want to go anywhere.", "Driftwood – A completely normal town focused largely on industry. The only strange thing about it is that it floats freely on the surface of a giant lake with nothing to control which direction it goes. Because it has no way of controlling where it is, it is almost impossible to find without the use of magic.", "Troad-mouth – a small mining town known for its unique gems, strange animals, sick populace, and permanently warm soil (town has a lot of radiation, but it hasn’t been discovered yet).", "Stormhaven – city built around a mountain, which is permanently covered in clouds of a residing elder tempest, worshipped by all of its citizens. Tempest and Knowledge clerics are the rulers and embodiments of endless power and infinite wisdom of their thunder god. Only the bravest of the warriors who manage to climb the top of the mountain can become members of the elite Order of thunders that protect the nearby realms and that sails the seas, bringing storms and destruction to all enemies, while chanting ‘we are the storm!’", "Borgona – At first this town seems completely normal. However, as the players explore, everything seems a little off. The players will gradually get clues as to what is gong on in this town. Every building smells like rotten eggs. The town is too quiet and peaceful. No one owns candles. Many people from out of town inexplicably moved in. Hard to spot Trails of ooze inside the buildings. The residents seem absent minded, only noticing players if they make a noise. If the players try to leave, the residents might insist that they stay, at which point the players will soon realize the town has been taken over by many obliges: a memory eating monster that can create dummies using the memories it has eaten.", "Wave Borough – A beach where a kraken was about to attack, but a wizard who is a master of time-based magic sacrificed themself, freezing them, the kraken, and the tidal wave the kraken summoned, frozen in time. Since the wave is solid, it has the properties of dense stone rather than water, and the city has expanded to build on top of it and the kraken.", "The Bridge – A giant stone archway several miles wide connect the peaks of two mountains, which are both infested with monsters. The entire town is built on the sturdy bridge, with wizards employed to ensure it never collapses.", "Saylen – The elvish word for Starfall. A town in the middle of an open field, but a strange magnetic pull causes shooting stars and other meteorites to be drawn to the surrounding field. Entire guilds race to whenever a new star crashes in order to harness its resources, though the occasional monster will crash as well.", "Towertown – A wizard’s tower that’s bigger on the inside. The wizard died long ago, but the Kenku he employed still live there. They’ve been there for generations, creating several family lineages within the giant tower.", "Frogsmarch – This city is built up in the mountains next to what appears to be a frozen swamp. Long ago, a hag named Aunt Biddyboty lived in the swamp, and made a deal with a Frost Giant Jarl that ended very badly. Calling on ancient magics, the Frost Giants wove a powerful spell that transported the swamp, in entirety, high up to its current location, freezing it to the spot immediately. Legends say there are valuables in the marsh, waiting next to monsters still frozen in place…", "Mecha – This city is the most sacred pilgrimage site for constructs. Constructs whose masters were slain or have developed a consciousness of their own flock to this city for protection, a sense of community, and to pay homage to holy relic in the center of the city. This relic, upon inspection, is a large, silvery comet that had impacted the land centuries ago. It is rumored that some sort of creature lives within it as some claim they have heard noises within it.", "Morvin’s Retreat – Built on a giant stretch of earth that moves ever so slowly across the countryside, Morvin’s Retreat is home to the clan of Hopkipper gnomes, who take delight in designing impractical devices to study the reason for the movement of the city. The stretch of earth moves at a rate of about a mile every two weeks, and moves in a seemingly random direction.", "Hoow’Card – A city originally inhabited by Elves, then spoiled by Orcs for generations, then retaken by Humans for generations, then abandoned to Orcs again, then eventually retaken by Humans. As a result, the city is a fascinating mix of different architectures and cultures. The one constant for the city is the Goblin underclass, who live in the poor edges of the city and run a well-established Thieves’ Guild.", "Black Lung’s Bend – An all-human mining town a half a mile above sea level and the nearest seaport. Population: 65. They mine for coal and do intense manual labor. But for some reason, no one is sick. Or old. Or young actually, everyone is exactly 30 years old. And only male…. and when they get hurt, the go to the deepest parts of the mines and come back healed. Weird.", "Often Island – A small, remote village that semiannually becomes an island due to intense seasonal flooding. 6 months out of the year they are an important supplier of fish for the empire. During both of the three-month long floods every year, one band of pirates or another usually takes over until military forces arrive as the flood subsides.", "Kingdom of the Wave Wall – A small coastal kingdom that has existed on the brink of disaster for centuries now. A tsunami that almost destroyed the city was frozen in time by the king’s trusted elven sorcerer. As he has aged, the spell has begun to lose its power and now the wall of water has begun to creep ever closer to the city. The sorcerer has fallen ill and the kingdom seems to be on the verge of destruction.", "Gallomir – a Dwarven village built on a steep cliffside, similar to the Adobe Pueblo settlements in Colorado. The town has a rich tourism industry which has overtaken it’s mining roots, resulting in many abandoned shafts where creepy crawlies lurk, and somewhat depressed ex-miners who hate their jobs as tour guides, gift shop workers, etc. The town mayor, Pratten, leads in a state of turmoil as many rebel against the tourism industry in favor of returning to it’s industrial glory days.", "Beva’Rahj – A town for performers retirement. This place is where the bards, dancers, poets, opera singers, and everything in between comes when it’s their time to lay down the dancing shoes, quills, instruments, or costumes. Almost everyone here is in good spirits, though with this many people devoted to the beauty and arts that is not surprising. Feel free to visit and hear the tales of the entire world with these people, just be sure not to linger after dark if you don’t also share the love of the stage…", "Tacot: Population 51, mostly human, some other civilized races. A series of low stone walls divides and encircles the thorp. It is governed by the local priest, a male human named Gery Wyarde.", "Ornodskali: Population 35, mixed dwarf and gnome. A series of low stone walls divides and encircles the thorp. It is governed by a noble aristocrat, the dwarf lord Zaghal. Ornodskali is the home of a legendary hero, a sorcerer named Gedu.", "Nulbadin: Population 32, mostly dwarf, some gnome. Most of the thorp is delved into the sides of a rocky hill. It is governed by a court of aristocrats, led by a male dwarf named Anzin. Nulbadin serves as a military outpost, and its citizens are armed.", "Coadale: Population 22, mostly human, some dwarf and gnome. The thorp is dominated by a single tall tower.
